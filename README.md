# PoseDetector
A program that detects the 33 unique points on your body!

It uses mediapipe (by Google) and its pretrained models with a data set of thousands of body photos to determine the unique 33 points in our body.

This program is made using python supported by streamlit.

This program could be used to make many innovative projects that require body detection and/or body motion tracking.
